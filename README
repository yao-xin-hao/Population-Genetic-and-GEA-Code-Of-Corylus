Branch Overview

01. call_snp
https://github.com/yao-xin-hao/Population-Genetic-and-GEA-Code-Of-Corylus/tree/01.call_snp
A Snakemake workflow for SNP calling based on the GATK pipeline.
This branch processes raw fastq files to BAM files into high‑quality VCF files, including:
1、GATK best‑practice variant discovery
2、Common filtering steps
3、Custom helper scripts
4、Generation of high-quality SNP sets

02. script_process_for_vcf:https
https://github.com/yao-xin-hao/Population-Genetic-and-GEA-Code-Of-Corylus/tree/02.script_process_for_vcf
A collection of useful scripts for VCF processing.
Main purpose:
1、Filling missing SNPs
3、Minor data cleanup
4、Preparing VCF files for downstream analyses

03. population_structure
https://github.com/yao-xin-hao/Population-Genetic-and-GEA-Code-Of-Corylus/tree/03.population_structure
Workflows and scripts for population structure analysis starting directly from VCF input.
Includes both analysis and visualization:
1、PCA
2、Neighbor‑Joining (NJ) tree
3、Admixture analysis
4、Results from these methods are combined to infer population structure.

04. GEA (Genotype-Environment Association)
https://github.com/yao-xin-hao/Population-Genetic-and-GEA-Code-Of-Corylus/tree/04.GEA
Scripts and workflows for environmental association studies.
Includes:
1、Extraction and processing of environmental variables
2、LFMM workflow (considers population structure)
3、RDA workflow (considers multiple environmental predictors)

05. IBD_IBE (Isolation by Distance / Environment)
https://github.com/yao-xin-hao/Population-Genetic-and-GEA-Code-Of-Corylus/tree/05.IBD_IBE
Scripts for evaluating geographic and environmental isolation using VCF input.
This branch generates:
1、Geographic distance matrices
2、Genetic differentiation matrices
3、Environmental distance matrices
4、And performs Mantel tests to evaluate correlations between:
Environment ↔ Genetic differentiation
Geography ↔ Genetic differentiation
Visualization scripts are included.
